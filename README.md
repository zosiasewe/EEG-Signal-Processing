# Evolutionary-Fuzzy Feature Extraction in EEG Signal Processing for Taste Stimuli

This project consists of my proposed method for the Feature Extraction process. 

##  Data Set

The data set was recorded from 10 participants in a taste stimulus process. It was divided into a class of people eating with their noses closed and a class of people with their noses open.

**Division of the Data Set**:
- **Nose closed** - 5 participants
- **Nose opened** - 5 participants

The project aimed to binary classify the data and see the performance for the taste stimuli process, and also to see how the novel feature extraction method works.

##  Project Overview:
1. Analysis of the data
2. Preprocessing of the EEG data
3. Novel Feature Extraction method
4. Feature Selection
5. Classification
6. Checking which configuration of parameters was the best
